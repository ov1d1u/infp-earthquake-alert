## About
This Home Assistant add-on connects to Telegram using your personal account and listen for earthquake alerts coming from "Alerta Cutremur" bot from INFP or "EarthBot" from Trisoft.

## Configuring
To use this add-on you will need a Telegram API ID, a Telegram API Key and a Telegram Session Hash. Get your Telegram API ID and Telegram API Key from https://my.telegram.org/apps, then head to https://gitpod.io/new/#snapshot/edc1bfc0-7b14-49eb-b684-cb4143aa53e0 . Import the workspace into your Gitpod account then, in the bottom part of the screen (the terminal section), fill the Telegram API ID and Telegram API Hash. Then, enter your phone number and the code you will just receive after that. You will get as response a long string: that's your Telegram Session Hash.
